# password-generator-tool--lerning-js
In this project, I'm going to create a password generator tool where I'll ask the user to select the criteria they want to use before pressing a button to generate a strong password.

The password must be between 8 and 128 characters long and may contain numbers, special characters, lowercase, and uppercase letters.

The user will be able to copy the password once it is displayed in this text area.
